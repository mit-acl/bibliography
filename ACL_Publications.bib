@article{Aoude11_ITS,
 abstract = {The ability to classify driver behavior lays the foundation for more
advanced driver assistance systems. In particular, improving safety
at intersections has been identified as a high priority due to the
large number of intersection related fatalities. This paper focuses
on developing algorithms for estimating driver behavior at road intersections
and validating them on real traffic data. It introduces two classes
of algorithms that can classify drivers as compliant or violating.
They are based on i) Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ii) Hidden
Markov Models (HMM), which are two very popular machine learning
approaches that have been used successfully for classification in
multiple disciplines. However, existing work has not explored the
benefits of applying these techniques to the problem of driver behavior
classification at intersections. The developed algorithms are successfully
validated using naturalistic intersection data collected in Christiansburg,
VA, through the US Department of Transportation Cooperative Intersection
Collision Avoidance System for Violations (CICAS-V) initiative. Their
performances are also compared to those of three traditional methods,
and the results show significant improvements with the new algorithms.},

@article{Cummings11_IEEE,
 abstract = {For future systems that require one or a small team of operators to
supervise a network of automated agents, automated planners are critical
since they are faster than humans for path planning and resource
allocation in multivariate, dynamic, time-pressured environments.
However, such planners can be brittle and unable to respond to emergent
events. Human operators can aid such systems by bringing their knowledge-based
reasoning and experience to bear. Given a decentralized task planner
and a goal-based operator interface for a network of unmanned vehicles
in a search, track, and neutralize mission, we demonstrate with a
human-on-the-loop experiment that humans guiding these decentralized
planners improved system performance by up to 50%. However, those
tasks that required precise and rapid calculations were not significantly
improved with human aid. Thus, there is a shared space in such complex
missions for human #x02013;automation collaboration.},

 abstract = {We present a novel POMDP problem formulation for a robot that must autonomously decide where to go to collect new and scientifically relevant images, given a limited ability to communicate with its human operator. From this formulation we derive constraints and design principles for the observation model, reward model, and communication strategy of such a robot, exploring techniques to deal with the very high-dimensional observation space and scarcity of relevant training data. We introduce a novel active reward learning strategy based on making queries to help the robot minimize path ``regret'' online and evaluate it for suitability in autonomous visual exploration through simulations. We demonstrate that, in some bandwidth limited environments, this novel regret-based criterion enables the robotic explorer to collect up to 17{\textbackslash}\% more reward per mission than the next-best criterion.},

 abstract = {The gradient projection anti-windup (GPAW) scheme was recently proposed
for saturated multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems driven
by MIMO nonlinear controllers, a topic recognized as an open problem
in a recent survey paper. Thus far, stability results for GPAW compensated
systems are restricted to the simple case of a saturated first order
linear time invariant (LTI) plant driven by a first order LTI controller.
Here, we present a region of attraction (ROA) comparison result for
general GPAW compensated regulatory systems. The ROA comparison result
is demonstrated on a simple planar nonlinear system, which also highlights
the limitations of existing state-of-the-art anti-windup results.},
